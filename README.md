# Credit Card Fraud Detection README

## Overview
This project implements a credit card fraud detection system using machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to identify fraudulent transactions based on historical transaction data. The model employs a Random Forest Classifier, which is trained on a balanced dataset to ensure high accuracy in detecting fraudulent activities.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, clone the repository and ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. Follow the instructions below to set up your environment and run the code.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following libraries installed:
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `imbalanced-learn`
- `joblib`

You can install them using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn imbalanced-learn joblib
```

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found at the following URL:
```
https://path_to_your_dataset.csv
```
Replace this URL with the actual path to your dataset. The dataset should contain various features related to credit card transactions, with a target variable named `Class` indicating whether a transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
   cd credit-card-fraud-detection
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To run the fraud detection model, execute the following Python script:
```bash
python fraud_detection.py
```

### Code Explanation
- **Import Libraries**: Import necessary libraries for data manipulation, model training, and evaluation.
- **Load Dataset**: Load the dataset from the specified URL.
- **Preprocess Data**: Split the data into features (X) and target (y), then into training and test sets.
- **Standardization**: Standardize the features to improve model performance.
- **Handle Class Imbalance**: Use SMOTE to balance the training dataset.
- **Train Model**: Train a Random Forest Classifier on the balanced dataset.
- **Evaluate Model**: Print the confusion matrix and classification report to assess model performance.
- **Save Model**: Save the trained model to a file for future use.

## Model Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using a confusion matrix and a classification report, which provides precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. This helps in understanding how well the model is performing in detecting fraudulent transactions.

## Saving the Model
The trained model is saved using Joblib, allowing for easy deployment and future predictions. The model can be loaded later for inference:
```python
import joblib
model = joblib.load('fraud_detection_model.pkl')
```
